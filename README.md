EcomWeb is a fully functional E-commerce website I have created for a fictional company. I am using React/Redux with the use of Firebase while integrating the Stripe payment processing API. Some of the main things implimented currently...

  - React/Redux
  - redux-persist for storrage session
  - Firebase


## Still to do:
 *  Integrate the Stripe payment API
 *  Change to using styled components
 *  Make more mobile friendly
 *  Write unit tests
